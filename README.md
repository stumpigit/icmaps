## Overview
**Visit the live version on [https://ICMaps.org](https://icmaps.org)**
With ICMaps you create your own map server and can integrate your maps into any Web3 or Web2 application and even access them via GIS software. This means that the maps are stored decentrally. Thanks to the scalability of the internet computer, you can store as many map tiles as you like, the memory never runs out.

In order to provide your own map server, you need an Internet Computer Container and are responsible for ensuring that there are enough cycles to run the container. In return, ICMaps takes care of the installation of the software and maintenance of the container, completely free of charge. You can either create containers with the Internet Computer SDK or simply create them online via the NNS Dapp. No programming knowledge is necessary. You can find more information on the Canister page.

Once your container is connected to ICMaps, you can easily transfer tiles from existing tile servers or WMTS servers. Afterwards you can see the preview of the map under Preview and also the code how to integrate the map into your web application.
